My research focuses on the intersections of digital humanities, visual culture, and 20th-century U.S. cultural and intellectual history. My current research uses digital technologies to explore how the political cartoonist Herbert Block articulated and channeled the currents of postwar liberalism. I have also worked on and led numerous funded research projects and has written articles for publications as diverse as Toward the Meeting of the Waters: Currents in the Civil Rights Movement in South Carolina and The DATA BASE for Advances in Information Systems. Together with Jennifer Guiliano, I am the co-author of [DevDH.org](http://devdh.org/), an online resource for digital humanities project development, and the forthcoming book *Getting Started in the Digital Humanities*.
