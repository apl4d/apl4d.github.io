No matter how digital humanities is defined, the development of research agendas encompasses the planning, organizing, motivating, and use of finite resources to achieve a greater understanding of the humanities and the human condition. DevDH.org provides the intellectual and strategic scaffolding to aid researchers in successfully completing their research endeavors. Responding to the increasing number of first-time digital humanists who are initiating projects, as well as the growing mandate from Universities and Colleges to undertake digital humanities-based research and teaching, DevDH introduces a series of resources to aid those who might be seeking assistance.

DevDH.org is the brainchild of Simon Appleford and Jennifer Guiliano, who collectively have over a decade working in digital humanities project development, management, and grant writing. DevDH (or develop DH) was built to respond to the growing demand for digital humanities training in that area but also as an online repository of training materials, lectures, exemplars, and links that offer best practices to beginner, intermediate, and advanced digital humanists. As a visitor to the site, you’ll have access to a number of presentations, guides, and examples that we’ve created or selected for their contribution to digital humanities as a discipline.

The materials designed for this digital resource draw from over a combined decade of experience from four different types of digital humanities centers as well as independent digital humanities projects. They were initially constructed as a lecture series for a co-taught Digital Humanities Winter Institute course, Project Development. The materials included in this “beta” release were created and/or recorded during that five-day long training event. They have been augmented with additional resources and readings to provide greater context for the scope of what can be done with digital humanities projects and teams.

We invite you to explore the resources consisting of slidedecks, bibliographies, digital templates, and podcasts. It is our hope that these materials spark a conversation about best practices and standards within the digital humanities writ large. And more specifically, we anticipate that these could jumpstart conversations about not just what the products of digital humanities research are but the process by which we get to those end results. We believe these lessons can be a starting point for conversations and hope that you’ll join us discussing how to build and sustain the digital humanities.
