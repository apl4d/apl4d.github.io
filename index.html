		<p>I am an Assistant Professor of <a title="Creighton University Department of History" href="https://www.creighton.edu/ccas/history/">History</a> at <a title="Creighton University" href="https://www.creighton.edu">Creighton University</a> and Associate Director of Creighton&rsquo;s Digital Humanities Initiative. My research focuses on the intersections of digital humanities, visual culture, and 19th- and 20th-century U.S. cultural and intellectual history. My current research uses digital technologies to explore how the political cartoonist Herbert Block articulated and channeled the currents of postwar liberalism. I have also worked on and led numerous funded research projects and have written articles for publications as diverse as <em>Current Research in Digital History</em>,&nbsp;<em>Toward the Meeting of the Waters: Currents in the Civil Rights Movement in South Carolina</em> and <em>The DATA BASE for Advances in Information Systems</em>. Together with Jennifer Guiliano, I am the co-author of <a title="DevDH.org" href="http://devdh.org">DevDH.org</a>, an online resource for digital humanities project development.</p>
